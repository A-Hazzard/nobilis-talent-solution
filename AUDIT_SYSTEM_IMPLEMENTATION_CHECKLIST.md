# Admin Audit Logging System: Implementation Checklist & Double-Check Prompt

This file is a comprehensive checklist and Cursor prompt for implementing and verifying a robust audit (activity logging) system for the admin panel. Use this to ensure every required step is complete and nothing is missed.

---

## **Overall Plan Summary**

- **Goal:** Log all admin actions (login, create, update, delete) on all admin-managed entities (Leads, Resources, Testimonials, Blog, Calendar, etc.)
- **Centralized Logging:** Store all logs in a dedicated Firestore collection (`adminLogs` or `auditLogs`).
- **Display:** Show real recent activity in the admin dashboard, replacing any fake data.
- **Type Safety & Security:** All log types in `shared/types/`, no sensitive data in logs, only admins can write/read logs.
- **Code Quality:** All code must pass lint, type checks, and follow project structure rules.

## **Implementation Steps Checklist**

### 1. **Type Definitions**
- [ ] Create or update `shared/types/audit.ts` (or `entities.ts`) with a type like:
  ```typescript
  export type AuditLog = {
    id?: string;
    timestamp: number;
    userId: string;
    userEmail?: string;
    action: 'login' | 'create' | 'update' | 'delete';
    entity: 'lead' | 'resource' | 'testimonial' | 'blog' | 'calendar' | 'auth';
    entityId?: string;
    details?: Record<string, any>;
  };
  ```

### 2. **Firestore Logging Helper**
- [ ] Create `lib/helpers/auditLogger.ts` with a function:
  ```typescript
  export async function logAdminAction(log: Omit<AuditLog, 'id'>): Promise<void>;
  ```
- [ ] Ensure it writes to the `adminLogs` collection and never throws (logs errors to console only).

### 3. **Integrate Logging in Services/API**
- [ ] In **LeadsService**: Log after every create, update, delete.
- [ ] In **ResourcesService**: Log after every create, update, delete.
- [ ] In **TestimonialsService**: Log after every create, update, delete.
- [ ] In **BlogService**: Log after every create, update, delete.
- [ ] In **CalendarService**: Log after every create, update, delete.
- [ ] In **Auth/Login API**: Log every successful admin login (with IP/user agent if available).
- [ ] Remove any unused imports or variables related to old/fake logging.

### 4. **Admin Dashboard: Real Recent Activity**
- [ ] Update `useDashboard` hook to fetch recent logs from Firestore (`adminLogs`), not fake data.
- [ ] Update the admin dashboard page to display real recent activity from logs.

### 5. **Security & Type Safety**
- [ ] Only log actions for admin users (check UID in all log calls).
- [ ] Never log sensitive data (e.g., passwords, tokens).
- [ ] All log writes and reads use the shared `AuditLog` type.

### 6. **Linting, Build, and Testing**
- [ ] Run `pnpm lint` and fix all errors/warnings (especially unused imports/vars).
- [ ] Run `pnpm build` and ensure type checks pass.
- [ ] Manually test all admin actions and verify logs are created in Firestore.
- [ ] Manually test the dashboard to ensure real logs are displayed.

### 7. **Documentation & Review**
- [ ] Add/Update comments in all new/changed files.
- [ ] Review Firestore security rules for the `adminLogs` collection.
- [ ] Double-check that all code follows project structure and Next.js/TypeScript rules.

## **Cursor Prompt: Final Double-Check**

- [ ] **Have you checked every service and API route for proper audit logging integration?**
- [ ] **Are all log types imported from `shared/types/` and not duplicated?**
- [ ] **Is the admin dashboard displaying real, up-to-date activity from Firestore?**
- [ ] **Are all unused imports/variables removed?**
- [ ] **Does the codebase pass `pnpm lint` and `pnpm build` with zero errors?**
- [ ] **Have you manually tested all admin actions and verified logs in Firestore?**
- [ ] **Are Firestore security rules set so only admins can write/read logs?**
- [ ] **Is there any sensitive data being logged? (If so, remove it!)**
- [ ] **Is every log entry timestamped and includes admin UID?**
