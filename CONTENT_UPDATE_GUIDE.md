```

### 4) Values — replace Core Values
- File: `components/AboutSection.tsx` (values array)
- Replace existing values with:

```md
Values

People at the Heart
- Every strategy we design begins with the human experience – unlocking potential, inspiring growth, and honoring the unique value each person brings.

Trusted Partnerships
- We intentionally collaborate. We work alongside you as a strategic partner, building solutions together that fit your goals, culture, and vision.

Integrity in Action
- We lead with transparency, authenticity and accountability. Our recommendations are grounded in what’s right for you, your people and your business – not in quick fixes.

Growth as a Way of Life
- We champion continuous learning, adaptability and resilience, helping leaders and teams turn challenges into catalysts for transformation. We push ourselves and our clients to be better.

Measurable Impact
- We focus on strategies that produce real, measurable outcomes.
```

### 5) Services — consolidate to a single page and remove pricing from UI
- Keep: `app/services/page.tsx` as the single services page.
- Remove pricing: delete pricing objects/mentions in the services data and hide any price UI.
- Update homepage section: `components/ServicesSection.tsx` to show concise tiles (no pricing) linking to `/services`.

Paste these service items (titles + summaries) into both the homepage Services tiles and the full Services page:

```md

```

Multiple services pages currently exist (homepage tiles and a detailed page; optionally a dynamic slug). Make it one:
- Preferred: keep only `/services` and delete `app/services/[slug]/` directory. Before deleting, search for imports/usages.
- Alternative: keep files and add a rewrite so any `/services/:slug` resolves to `/services`.
  - File: `next.config.js` → in `rewrites()` add:

```js
{
  source: '/services/:slug*',
  destination: '/services',
}
```

### 6) Pricing policy — omit from site
- Do not show any prices on the website. In `app/services/page.tsx` and `components/ServicesSection.tsx` remove any price/duration fields and their UI.
- Coaching package PDFs can be prepared separately; do not link pricing publicly yet.

### 7) Contact & availability — update email everywhere
- File: `components/ContactSection.tsx`
  - Set email link to `nobilis.talent@gmail.com`.
  - Add a small note “Available globally.” in the contact details or footer of the card.
- File: `components/Footer.tsx`
  - Update email to `nobilis.talent@gmail.com`.

### 8) SEO defaults — update site identity
- File: `components/SEO.tsx`
  - Update defaults:
    - `title`: `Nobilis Talent Solutions — Where strategy meets humanity`
    - `description`: Use the short, high-impact hero copy (first paragraph) summarized to one sentence.
  - Ensure open graph image is still valid or replace if needed.

### 9) Navigation — ensure Services points to the single page
- File: `components/Navigation.tsx`
  - Ensure the Services link routes to `/services`.
